# spa-react-useState-starter

Create a to-do list web application that allows the user to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application should have an input field for adding new tasks and display a list of all existing tasks. For each task in the list, the user should have the option to edit or delete it. When the user selects a task to edit, an input field should be displayed for editing the task. After the user completes the editing, the updated task should be saved.
